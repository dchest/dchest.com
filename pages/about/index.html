---

My name is **Dmitry Chestnykh** (pronounced as _chess-_, then _\-ni-h_ with _i_ as in “m**i**lk”, and _h_ as in “**h**i”).
I'm the founder of [Coding Robots](https://www.codingrobots.com/), where I write programs and consult on security and applied cryptography. I created [I Write Like](https://iwl.me), a website that analyzes writing using a Bayesian classifier (it's [open source](https://github.com/coding-robots/goiwl)). I wrote [Password authentication for web and mobile apps](/authbook/).
