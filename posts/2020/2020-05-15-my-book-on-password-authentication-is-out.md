I’m super excited to announce that my book, [Password authentication for web and mobile apps](/authbook/), is out! I have a lot more to say about why I decided to write it and what the writing and publishing process was in future blog posts. Meanwhile, if you’re a developer who wants to understand password authentication and implement it for your web site or your app, please check it out: <https://dchest.com/authbook/>
