title: "How to not give a fuck about business trends to find your niche"
---

[NearlyFreeSpeech.NET](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net) is a sharing hosting
provider with a pretty unique approach. The amount of fucks they give about
trends, be it industry business models or cloud stuff or "fanatical supportâ„¢
with customer champions", is close to zero. This is adorable and I highly
respect such people.

[Read their FAQ](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq) to understand what
I'm taking about.

Not catering to everyone:

> If one of those options works for you, great! If, on the other hand, you're
> looking for a more "high contact" approach to support or if you're looking
> for someone to create or manage a site for you, that's absolutely fine, but a
> do-it-yourself service like ours may not be the best fit for your needs.
>
> To put it another way, some people change their own oil. Some people pay a
> mechanic to do it because although they could do it themselves, they want to
> spend their time another way. And some people pay a mechanic to do it because
> they just want their car to work and the details don't interest them.
> NearlyFreeSpeech.NET is a service for people who want to change their web
> site's oil.

Turning the majority of customers away to focus on their ideal users:

> [Is your service easy to use?](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#Easy)
>
> No.
>
> Compared to the endless parade of hosts that provide tons of "one-click
> installs," one-size-fits-all web site templates, unlimited toll-free
> telephone support, and cookie-cutter control panels, our service is arcane
> and complex. We consider this a positive.

Being frugal and having a simple business model:

> [How can you make money at these prices?](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#Profit)
>
> It's not easy. For one thing, we keep overhead to a minimum. No fancy
> multi-acre Silicon Valley office palaces with slides and wandering masseurs
> here. No business development teams. No commission-driven sales force.
> 
> Also, we try to avoid doing stupid things that make no sense just because we
> heard someone else made a lot of money that way. That really helps.
> 
> This is not a loss leader, a limited time offer, or restricted to only
> certain people. This is our business model, and it works.

Having a usable and readable website instead of a fancy one with stock pictures:

> [Why doesn't your website look like other hosting provider sites?](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#UglySite)
>
> It's simple. We don't want to confuse people into thinking we're anything
> like other hosting providers. Our simple, text-based layout is designed to
> load fast, to be easy to use, and not to try to distract you from making an
> informed decision about us. As if that's not enough, we also think Jakob
> Nielsen is pretty cool.
>
> [...]

(You can say a lot about the state of the Web if having a simple,
usable website makes your business unique!)

Avoiding fancy marketing terms:

> [Is this cloud computing?](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#Cloud)
>
> No. Clouds are fluffy. We are not fluffy!
> 
> We have been using "cloud-like" principles since we started in 2002. We make
> heavy use of multiple virtualization technologies, hardware independence,
> shared resource pooling, load balancing and clustered job distribution. But
> we do not consider ourselves to be a cloud computing provider, if only
> because that's such a marketing term and really means very little. (We've
> seen it argued that "the cloud" is anything you don't host on equipment you
> own and operate yourself.)

Also: being honest, not taking websites down for bullshit reasons, etc.

Finally, using [FreeBSD](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#Hardware)
instead of Linux.

Hmm, of this reminds me of another FreeBSD-based service with a similar
attitude and pricing model: [Tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com/). I wonder if
there is a correlation :-)

P.S. I don't use NearlyFreeSpeech.NET myself because I need
[VPS](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#BigNumbers), but I have an
account with them.
