title: Blogging is probably not dead
---

I’ve been into blogging since around 2003 when I created
[BlogJet](https://www.blogjet.com/), one of the first blog clients for Windows
(it was later acquired and is not developed by me anymore). In 2005 I started a
[blog about marketing and online business](https://sellme.biz) in Russian,
which was quite popular and was one of the top&nbsp;10 standalone blogs
according to [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) for some time. Later I burned out
and essentially stopped blogging; while that blog is still online, I publish
only one or two posts per year.

Today twitters, facebooks and telegrams took all the audience, and while there
are still many blogs out there (probably even more than before), it’s quite
different from what we had in those days. Even WordPress.com now tells us to
"create an unforgettable website" rather than "a blog".

My main writing output today is in Twitter: every day I usually post a few
160-character tweets, which is quite a difference from the number of characters
used to write. (I think this significantly contributed to shortening of my
attention span.)

Today I watched this Michael Hyatt’s video from 2013 and it inspired me to
maybe start writing again:

<style>
.embed-responsive {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  height: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.embed-responsive .embed-responsive-item,
.embed-responsive iframe,
.embed-responsive embed,
.embed-responsive object,
.embed-responsive video {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border: 0;
}
.embed-responsive-16by9 {
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;
}
.embed-responsive-4by3 {
  padding-bottom: 75%;
}
</style>
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zBKYnYFrbic" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Michael is a great guy — he actually was an early user of BlogJet and later
helped me monetize [I Write Like](https://iwl.me) — and I’ve been following his
“blogging career” from the early days. Many blogs started during the blogging
boom are dead, but he’s been blogging for many years and it doesn’t look like
he’s going to stop.  He grew his audience tremendously. Huge inspiration!

So, right now I’m firing Vim, creating a new post, typing `kkr build &&
./rsync` to publish this post using [my homegrown artisanal static site
builder](http://github.com/dchest/kkr), and hoping that I’ll continue doing
this a few times a week.
