title: Introducing AI licensing for my works

There's been a lot of discussions regarding works produced by AI and their relation to copyright law.
There is a lot of uncertainty about it. Some may say that AI is _copyright laundering_.
That is why, inspired by my favorite organization, MPEG LA, I&nbsp;decided to:

- **introduce licensing for my works reproduced by AI**;

- **announce the creation of a copyright pool.** Anyone who believes that
their copyrighted work might be reproduced by AI can apply to be
included in the pool and will receive a portion of licensing fees
(minus the pool administration fee, of course). I expect this pool to grow to
around 8 billion authors (incl. people and some dolphins) so that the users
of AI-reproduced works can pay a simple licensing fee and be 100% sure that they can legally use them.
Details regarding the pool will be available later.

If your organization uses works produced by AI (for example, uses an image that was produced
by DALL·E on a website, or includes code produced by Github Copilot) it may be a derivative of my
work. You can use it after you get a license from me.

### What works does this apply to?

Licensing applies to all of my original works that I authored during my life
that are subject to copyright laws _if they are reproduced by the AI specified below_.
They don't apply to any of the works without the AI transformation. For licensing of works
reproduced by AI not mentioned here, please contact me.


### How do I know if what AI produced includes any of your work?

You probably don't.
It's up to you to decide if you accept the risk.
Many of my works have been available on the Internet (and some of them on Mars)
since at least 1999 under various licenses. Most of them are available under free
licenses that only require attribution, but some are only available for a fee.
**Some parts of them may turn out to be
included in the final result of what AI produced.
In general, if you cannot know for sure, it's better to get a license from me.**

### Are you sure you can claim copyright?

The question is whether my claim would
stand up in court. If there's a chance that my copyright claim is valid,
some result produced by AI might
be a derivative of my copyrighted work. It's up to you to decide what's better —
a risk of an expensive lawsuit or paying a small licensing fee to avoid such risks.

### Is this FUD?

Hmm, I'm not sure what "FUD" means and I'm afraid to look it up.


### Why should \*I\* pay instead of the companies that make AI?

I would welcome a licensing agreement with these companies.
However, there is no such agreement yet, so if you publish
my work transformed by AI, you'll have to license it.

MIT license, and then use this code under its terms, but I expect commercial users to be honest and not do such things.)_
